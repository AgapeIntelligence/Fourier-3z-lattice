# fourier-3z-lattice

Sparse Fourier analysis on the n-torus with frequency support restricted to (3ℤ)ⁿ.

Exact recovery of bandlimited fields from severely subsampled measurements via least-squares (or ℓ¹-minimization). Demonstrates perfect reconstruction on the 2D Klein bottle quotient and general n-dimensional tori using only the harmonic lattice generated by multiples of 3.

Relative error ≤ 10⁻¹⁴ with <10% random samples (machine precision).

## Files

- `lattice_3z_nD.py`         – Generates the (3ℤ)ⁿ frequency lattice in arbitrary dimension  
- `torus_2d_klein.py`         – 2-torus with enforced Klein bottle symmetry  
- `torus_3d_3zlattice.py`    – Pure 3-torus with full (3ℤ)³ support  
- `recovery_demo.py`         – Runs all examples and prints reconstruction errors  

## Requirements

```bash
pip install numpy scipy matplotlib
Quick start
python recovery_demo.py
Typical output (errors at double-precision limit):
[2D Klein] Error = 9.12e-15
[3D Torus] Measurements 8.0% → Relative error = 1.34e-14
Pure harmonic analysis / compressed sensing – no external dependencies beyond NumPy and SciPy.
